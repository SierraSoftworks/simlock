SIMLock - A SIM based locking daemon
----------------------------

Automatically locks the phone if the SIM card is changed.
Supports multiple valid SIM cards which can be added either using the command line
tool or by inserting them and subsequently unlocking the phone.

Usage:
    simlock [OPTIONS]

Options:
    --add -a	[IMSI]
	Adds the specified IMSI to the database
    --remove -r	[IMSI]
	Removes the specified IMSI from the database
    --show -s
	Shows a list of all the valid IMSI numbers in the database
    --clear -c
	Clears the list of IMSI numbers currently in the database
    --help -?
	Shows the built in help page
    -d
	Runs the startup daemon, locking the phone if an invalid IMSI number is detected

SIMLock is started automatically when the phone boots and will lock the phone if
it detects that the inserted SIM card has been changed. Additionally it will lock
the phone if there is no SIM card present.

To disable SIMLock simply uninstall the simlock package using the built in package
manager, or enter "sudo apt-get remove simlock" from the terminal.

The lock code used by SIMLock is determined by the lock code set in Settings/Device Lock
and should be configured prior to running or installing simlock.
